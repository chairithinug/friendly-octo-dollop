See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Briefly describe a problem that your team would like to solve.  
Describe at a high level a program that could solve that problem.

The office space is riddled with unnecessary and unproductive meetings. Employees are constantly having to pick which meetings to attend, and the question is: which meeting should the employee prioritize over another?

Our program would be based on a scheduler program. Based on input from the employee: do they like the meeting host, is the meeting topic relevant to them, etc. After meetings they would rate the  meeting on a scale based on multiple factors. The program would create a schedule of meetings for the employee to attend based on the priority of the meeting.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Meeting Manager Proposal



2. Output: Schedule for employee of meetings to attend throughout the day.



3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
Event Class // a Event object containing the detail about the event.
Person Class // a person class containing some characteristics and relevent information.
